# YoloV1 Self-Implementation

![YoloV1 Icon](https://example.com/yolov1-icon.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a self-implemented version of the YoloV1 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. YoloV1 is a groundbreaking deep learning model that redefines object detection by treating it as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities from full images in one evaluation. 

## Why We Did It

Our goal was to gain an in-depth understanding of object detection models by implementing YoloV1 from scratch. Instead of relying on pre-built libraries, this project emphasizes learning the underlying principles and mechanics that make YoloV1 one of the most efficient object detection models. This journey of building from the ground up provides invaluable insights into model architecture, training processes, and optimization techniques.

## Target Audience

This project is ideal for:
- **Students and Researchers** who want to deepen their understanding of computer vision and neural networks.
- **Developers** looking to explore the intricacies of object detection models.
- **AI Enthusiasts** interested in the implementation and learning journey behind powerful models like YoloV1.

## How We Did It

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: We started by curating a dataset suitable for object detection tasks, including images and corresponding annotations (bounding boxes and labels).
2. **Model Architecture Design**: The YoloV1 model was built from scratch, implementing the 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers as per the original paper.
3. **Loss Function Implementation**: We designed a custom loss function that simultaneously considers classification loss, localization loss, and confidence loss.
4. **Training Process**: The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent with various techniques like learning rate decay, data augmentation, and batch normalization to enhance performance.
5. **Evaluation and Tuning**: Post-training, the model was evaluated on a validation set, and hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize accuracy and detection speed.
